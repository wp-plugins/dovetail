Dovetail adds basic yet beautiful membership tools to your WordPress website. Use and enjoy.

== Description ==

Dovetail adds basic yet beautiful membership tools to your WordPress website. Our intention with Dovetail was to create a membership plugin which stayed as close to the "WordPress Way" as possible, whilst also being extendable and powerful. Think WooCommerce for membership.

Our idea is that Dovetail should compliment other plugins rather than just blindly copy their functionality (otherwise, why have plugins?) Want customised login screens? Install the excellent ["Theme My Login"](http://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/). Customised signup? [Gravity Forms](http://www.gravityforms.com/) with the [User Registration](http://www.gravityforms.com/add-ons/user-registration/) add on. And so on.

Right now Dovetail's fairly new, so there aren't any payment gateways. We're working on a PayPal one though with a view to eventually allow others to develop and payment gateway they choose and bolt it on.

Dovetail's been lovingly crafted by [Factory Pattern](http://factorypattern.co.uk) in the UK to service our clients' membership needs; it was forged in the fire of client projects and tested in the often harsh real world. Install it, try it and let us know your ideas; we're all ears.
